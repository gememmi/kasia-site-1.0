Worked on a separate tutorial for BrowswerRouter and now I need to finish connecting the BrowswerRouter throughout site for Kasia

3/18/24:
-completed all routing for navigation bar and logo/landing page
-worked on filling out About page with content
    -used Tiinyhost for hosting the pdf of her "resume"
-attempted to optimize the routing, but when I left for the day, my routes were conjuring an error that the component was not connected.

-got BrowswerRouter up and running, figured out all bugs. I had been using obsolete hooks (Switch is not Routes and you link to the element attribute, not component)
    -still not able to scroll to other elements with the functino I created, working on that.
-filled in simple content for Home, About, Gallery, and Menus. Currently setting up ContactForm. I have decided to use Web3Forms for the email form as a test to see if I prefer this service or emailjs more. 
-struggling through setting up web3forms correctly
-figured it out!!!

-trying to figure out how to scroll to each section, my scrollTo funciton did not work. Currently trying out useLocation and useRef
-GIVE UP on the scroll feature, I think I would have had to React Scroll from the beginning
